#** Pewlett Hackard Employee Retirement Analysis**

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is to determine the number of retiring employees by employment title and to identify employees
who will be eligible to participate in a mentorship program. It is important for the company to have the proper resources
and training available to handle the transformation of employment talent as the current group of senior employees reach retirement age. 

### Analysis and Challenges

The process for the is analysis consisted of the following steps:

1. Retirement Titles: Determine those employees who might be considering retirement. These were taken as a group of current employees
who were born January 1952 and December 1955. This is displayed by the following chart and includes 133,700 employees

2. Unique Titles: The Unique Titles table includes the employees shown above by their most recent job title less those who have left the company. (41381 employees)

As is seen the greatest quantity of jobs that need to be filled are those of Senior Engineer and Senior Staff. This would imply that a major effort
needs to be made to train and mentor those junior employees selected to fill those roles. Additional hiring will be needed to fill some of those
jobs as Senior Engineer and Staff people retire. 

5. Mentorship Eligibility: This table emphasizes those current senior employees (1709 employees shown) who are most qualified to participate in the company mentorship program where experienced senior members of the staff can be used to mentor more junior employees as their possible replacements at some point.
