#** Pewlett Hackard Employee Retirement Analysis**

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is to determine the number of retiring employees by employment title and to identify employees
who will be eligible to participate in a mentorship program. It is important for the company to have the proper resources
and training available to handle the transformation of employment talent as the current group of senior employees reach retirement age. 

### Analysis and Challenges

The process for the is analysis consisted of the following steps:

1. Retirement Titles: Determine those employees who might be considering retirement. These were taken as a group of current employees
who were born January 1952 and December 1955. This is displayed by the following chart and includes 133,700 employees out of a total number of 300024 or 44.56%

2. Unique Titles: The Unique Titles table includes the employees shown above by their most recent job title less those who have left the company. (41381 employees)
or 13.7% out of 300024.

3. Retiring Titles: This table produces those employees by title that are the most likely to retire.

4. Count of those likely to retire: Displays those job titles of the number most likely to retire from the Retiring Titles chart above.

As is seen the greatest quantity of jobs that need to be filled are those of Senior Engineer (25,916) and Senior Staff (24,926) or 16.7% of the total number of employees. This would imply that a major effort needs to be made to train and mentor those junior employees selected to fill those roles. Additional hiring will be needed to fill some of those jobs as Senior Engineer and Staff people retire. 

While it will take a major effort to fill these roles, this could provide an incentive for younger employees to stay with Pewlett-Hackard as a career path may be more defined in this situation.

5. Mentorship Eligibility: This table emphasizes those current senior employees (1709 employees shown) who are most qualified to participate in the company mentorship program where experienced senior members of the staff can be used to mentor more junior employees as their possible replacements at some point. This seems to be a low number considering the large number of employees who may be considering retirement. Perhaps new standards need to be reviewed as far as how senior members may be considered as a mentor or of the mentorship program as a whole.

Summary

This study suggests the need for a formal program to address the large number of retiring employees. This may be resolved by:

a. A review of current employees of who may be most qualified to fill these roles regardless of their tenure with the company
b. A review of recruiting efforts to attract and retain new employees
c. Provide incentives for current employees to be evaluated as far as participation in the mentorship program
d. Provide incentives for selected employees to be retained with the company until a suitable replacement can be trained.
